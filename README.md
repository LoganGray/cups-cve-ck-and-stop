# cups-cve-ck-and-stop
bash script to determine if a linux box is running the remote code execution CVE CUPS services and optionally shut them down and disable them, even automatically ;)


I've tested this on Ubuntu, Fedora and Pop-OS.

You can easy get this by doing:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoganGray/cups-cve-ck-and-stop/refs/heads/main/cups-cve-ck-and-stop.sh
chmod +x ./cups-cve-ck-and-stop.sh
sudo ./cups-cve-ck-and-stop.sh

```

and this will happen:

or if you just wanna run this non-interactively and just automatically check for the stuff and shut it down and disable simply add a **-y** to the end, like this:

```
sudo ./cups-cve-ck-and-stop.sh -y
```


__Why I wrote this?__

I personally run & manage a bunch of linux servers, and I love automating stuff...   so I wanted a script that I could just send to all the boxes and automatically turn off all the CUPS stuff quickly. :)

Feel free to use this, and even make an ansible play book to run it.
I use Jumpcloud, so sending this to all my servers was somewhat trivial. :P

Please let me know if you have any problems, questions etc.  I'll do what I can to address that kinda stuff.
